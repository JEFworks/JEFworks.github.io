Bioengineer and statistician by training.<br>  
Computer scientist by experience.<br>  
Artist at heart.<br>  
<br>  
At the interface of big data, genetics, and health.<br>    
<br>
Trying to cure cancer.<br>      
One single cell at a time.<br>      
Something like that.<br>      
<br>    
May this blog post serve as a reminder.<br>      
So I may hold myself accountable.<br>      
And remember where I came from.
